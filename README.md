# Q&A A/B testing

## Case Study
The Q&A platform has just introduced a new UI design to the app. The goal of the new design is to increase user engagement (measured by minutes spent on site). The team ran an A/B test to evaluate the change. Using the data, I will help the team understand the impact of the UI change better.

For the privacy of the data, I will only make the dataset visible in this Jupyter Notebook without posting the actual data on github.

## Recommendations
- Since the new UI had great impact on new users and non-readers, we can add a
screen/pop-up message to the UI to prompt these users to answer or ask more questions
related to their topics of interest . This can increase the conversion to become
contributors/readers for these users, which eventually benefit growth and retention.
- Explore and analyze the user interactions/activities stream with the new UI and compare the
differences between males and unknown genders versus females. The goal is to customize
UI for each gender group and optimize their engagement rate.
